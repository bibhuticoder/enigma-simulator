# Enigma-simulator
The legendary Enigma machine simulator in javascript.

Don't know what it is ? here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2_Q9FoD-oQ


## how to use
- store the numbers in rotors somewhere
- input a message 
- give the encrypted message to someone with the stored numbers 
- Then at the other side, re-configure the rotors to the stored numbers 
- enter the encrypted message, and the machine will decrypt it if the configuration is valid.


## demo
- the plugboard is still in progress but the simulation works fine as a normal enigma machine
